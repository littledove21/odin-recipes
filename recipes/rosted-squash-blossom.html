    <p>Oven roasting the squash blossoms, instead of frying, makes this a nice light summer dish.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bunch rainbow chard, stems removed and leaves chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 ounces goat cheese (chevre)</li>
        <li>8 zucchini blossoms, stamen removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven degrees F (200 dgrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium heat; add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in chard and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add basil, salt, and pepper, and cook until basil is soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Place cooled chard mixture between 2 towels and press to remove excess moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir goat cheese and chard mixture together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Fill zucchini blossoms about 3/4 full with the goat cheese mixture, and pinch the ends closed. Place filled blossoms in a roasting pan; drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven until squash blossoms are hot, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
