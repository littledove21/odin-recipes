    <p>This traditional Italian appetizer with zucchini flowers is perfect for spring and summer. Plus, thanks to rice flour in the batter, it's totally gluten-free.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup shredded fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>10 zucchini blossoms</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons rice flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup sparkling water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sweet rice flour</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in a bowl until well mixed. Stuff each zucchini blossom with 1 tablespoon cheese mixture; pinch ends closed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk rice flour, eggs, milk, sparkling water, sweet rice flour, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Dip stuffed blossoms into rice flour mixture; toss gently until coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Lower blossoms carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crisp and pale golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining blossoms.
        </li>
        <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
        <p>To avoid tearing, be gentle while stuffing the delicate flowers.</p>
        <p>You can substitute ricotta cheese for mozzarella.</p>
        <p>This version doesn't use baking powder, but you can add 1 teaspoon to puff the batter like tempura.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of this antipasto. Some add a piece of anchovy or even sun-dried tomatoes. Use your imagination!</p>
