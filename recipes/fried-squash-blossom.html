    <p>These fried squash blossoms are filled with a tangy goat cheese mixture and coated in a simple, light batter that fries up golden brown and perfectly crisp.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Squash Blossoms Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 fresh zucchini blossoms</li>
        <li>¾ cup soft goat cheese at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Gruyère cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

        <h3>Batter:</h3>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup ice-cold water, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Gently rinse the squash blossoms to remove any dirt or debris; remove the stamens as they are bitter and not edible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice-cold water. Drop squash blossoms into the boiling water until slightly wilted, 30 to 45 seconds; lift with a slotted spoon and immediately place into the cold water to chill. Remove and drain on paper towels. Add basil, salt, and pepper, and cook until basil is soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Place cooled chard mixture between 2 towels and press to remove excess moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make the filling: Mix goat cheese, Gruyère, egg yolk, pepper, and cayenne together in a bowl until smooth. Spoon into a 1-quart resealable plastic bag, squeeze out the air, and seal the bag. Cut a small corner off the bag.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently insert the cut corner of the bag into the open end of a blossom and pipe in about 1 tablespoon filling, making sure it fills all the way to the bottom. Lift petals up and drape over filling to cover completely. Fold any excess petals over the top of the filled blossom to keep them out of the way. Repeat to fill remaining blossoms. Refrigerate until cheese is set and firm, at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the batter: Combine flour and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Whisk in ice-cold water, a little at a time, until batter is smooth and has the thickness of pancake batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 inch oil in a cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). A drop of batter carefully dripped into the oil should sizzle immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove squash blossoms from the refrigerator and dust lightly with all-purpose flour on all sides. Shake off excess flour and dip blossoms in batter. Let excess batter drip off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently lay about six coated squash blossoms on their sides in hot oil and cook until pale golden brown, about 1 minute on the first side and 30 seconds to 1 minute on the remaining sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat to fry remaining blossoms. Let cool slightly before serving.
